Contains two components:

* DoubleClick
* DragAndDrop

Both components will navigate to a target frame based on their named interaction.

**DoubleClick**

This adds as a hotspot. Simply add a target frame, a fill if you want to see the hotspot, and optionally a double click speed in ms (default is 300). Set opacity to 0 if you don't want to see the hotspot.

**DragAndDrop**

Drag and drop will enable the user to drag the content to a certain spot defined by the top,left,bottom,right coordinates. If you leave this to 0, dropping the component anywhere forwards to the target frame.
